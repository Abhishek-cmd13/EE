                <p>CoCubes.com was established by Harpreet Grover and Vibhore Goyal. From being room mates at IIT Bombay to building a company that connected 3 million students across India&nbsp; and 1000+ corporates and colleges at the time it was acquired by Aon Hewitt.</p>
                <p>It started in Room 143 at IIT Bombay and both soon enough had quit their jobs and launched Cocubes. Back in 2000-05 we all know their was a growth in&nbsp; large number of colleges in India and most of them are tier-2 and tier-3 and all the employers were in metros, and there seemed to be no way to connect, they thought it was a problem worth solving.</p>
                <p>Then their came the idea of CoCubes and then they spent the next decade building a company before exiting it successfully. From no money in their banks for eight years after graduating to becoming dollar millionaires in 2016. This shows they had a dream, and through perseverance, they made it come true.</p>
                <p>In 2019 both the founders exited the company but CoCubes still continues to grow and create opportunities for the team members working there, while creating wealth for Aon.</p>
                <p>After exiting from CoCubes both the founders started angel investing, also working with other entrepreneurs in their journeys and they published the book "Let's Build A Company: A startup story minus the bullshit." based on the story of CoCubes which is a great book and an inspiration for new startups for their entrepreneurial journey.</p>
                <p>We hope you find, in your life, whatever brings out the best in you, and that you have the courage to see it through. Hope you are inspired by this authentic account of an entrepreneurial journey.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -Let's build a Company.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
